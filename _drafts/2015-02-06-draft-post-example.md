To author new posts in draft mode, create and compose posts in the `_drafts` directory. This directory and the posts it contains will be excluded when you serve and build your site.

To see your drafts locally, install the bowtie-io gem and run `bowtie serve --drafts`. This will add your draft posts to your blog. If you omit the `--drafts` tag, you will not see your drafts. Once you complete a draft, move the file to your `_posts` directory and build/commit your changes.

Your site will be visible at localhost:4000 Your project posts page can be found at “%projectName%/blog/“ by default.
